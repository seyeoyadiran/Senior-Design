# Summary of Expenses

For this project I tried to spend as little money as possible by using things that I already had. I ended up spending $0 in total for the creation of this 
game. However I will let you know how much the tools I used cost during the development process.


| Tools  | Price |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Mac M1 Mini  | $600  |
| Unreal Engine | $ 0 |
| External SSD 1TB| $90 |
