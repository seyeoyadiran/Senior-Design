# Summary of Hours

For this project in the fall Semester, as a solo developer, I spent about a week researching and experimenting with different game engines and chose 
the unreal engine. For the first half of the semester,I spent on creating a gameplan fodr what I wanted to accomplish by creating a project roadmap,
user diagrams, and researching game engines. For the second half of the fall semester. After long hours researching game engines, downloading several engines, and testing out each one, I chose Unreal Engine. Alongside this I spent many weeks reading the unreal Engine documetation and creating mini projects to gain more comfortability and confidence with Unreal.  


For the spring semester I focused mainly on implementation. For the beginning of the spring semester I fcocused on creating landscapes and maps for an enjoyable experience. After creating 2 usable maps, I worked on trying to figure out Unreal Player locomotion and creating animations for a smooth and fun gameplay. Eventually I discoverered Unreal Assets and begin adding them into my game. The rest of the semester was spent on making the game logic, UI, and fixing bugs.
