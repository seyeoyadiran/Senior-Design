#Summary of Hours

For this project in the fall Semester, as a solo developer, I spent about a week researching and experimenting with different game engines and chose 
the unreal engine. For the first half of the semester,I spent on creating a gameplan fodr what I wanted to accomplish by creating a project roadmap,
user diagrams, and researching game engines. For the second half of the fall semester. After long hours researching game engines, trying them out, and downlading hundreds of gigabytes of gaming software onto my computer, I chose the Unreal Engine. Alongside this I spent many weeks reading the unreal Engine documetation and creating mini projects to gain more comfortability with Unreal.  


For the Spring Semester I spent this time implementing alot of the features I once aimed for in the project roadmap. For the first half of the Spring Semester,


some of the planning from both semesters in the table of contents in the README. 

Thank You for Reading.
