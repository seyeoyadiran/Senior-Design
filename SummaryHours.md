#Summary of Hours

For this project in the fall Semester, as a solo developer, I spent about a week researching and experimenting with different game engines and chose 
the unreal engine. For the first 20 hours of the project I spent on creating a gameplan for what I wanted to accomplish by creating a project roadmap to
some of the features I wanted to add. For the remaining 25 hours of the fall semester, I spent on reading the Unreal Ungine documentation on their website
while creating mini projects along the way to learn unreal as a beginner. 

For the Spring Semester I spent this time implementing alot of the features I once aimed for in the project roadmap. For the 45 hours I spent the time 
researching and implementing features such as map creation, player locomotion, and gameplay creation to create the mvp for the gameplay Dirty/Durty Soccer.
You will be able to see some of the planning from both semesters in the table of contents in the README. 

Thank You for Reading.
